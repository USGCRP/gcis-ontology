    dc:description <https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sempublishing/code/BiRO/BiRO.png>, """BiRO, the Bibliographic Reference Ontology, is an ontology structured according to the FRBR model to define bibliographic records (as subclasses of frbr:Work) and bibliographic references (as subclasses of frbr:Expression), and their compilations into bibliographic collections such as library catalogues, and into bibliographic lists such as reference lists in journal articles, respectively.
It provides a logical system for relating an individual bibliographic reference, such as appears in the reference list of a published article (which may lack the title of the cited article, the full names of the listed authors, or indeed the full list of authors):
- to the full bibliographic record for that cited article, which in addition to missing reference fields may also include the name of the publisher, and the ISSN or ISBN of the publication;
- to collections of bibliographic records such as library catatlogues; and
- to bibliographic lists, such as reference lists."""^^xsd:string ;

Note that because different journal styles may require omission of elements of the bibliographic record in references included in a paper's reference list (e.g. the title, the identifier, the names of the eighth and subsequent authors), and because errors can be introduced when an author creates a bibliographic reference, the bibliographic reference to a published work may not be a complete or fully accurate expression of the information contained within the authoritative bibliographic record for that work."@en ;
